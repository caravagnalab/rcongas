Models for clustering and segmentation available in this package are listed via `list_models()`.

Each model has one code associated to it, which should be used as parameter for fitting functions requiring a `model` argument.

```{r}
list_models()
```

# Models for clustering

## MixtureGaussian

Model with LogNormal prior for CNV and Poisson likelihood

## MixtureGaussianNorm

Model with LogNormal prior for CNV and Gaussian likelihood


# Models for segmentation

##  HmmSegmenter        

Hmm with Beta emission probabilities for MAF segmentation (experimental, use it just for a rough initial segmentation)
