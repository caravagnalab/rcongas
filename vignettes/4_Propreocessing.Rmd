As the joint calling of CN alteration, data normalization and clustering is extremely challenging and characterized by different degree of freedom a filtering step is essential to ensure we are not inflating our false positive count.
First of all a filter on highly variable and highly expressed genes can be extremely useful as it tends to remove cell specific markers and those genes that can create significant deviations in the total counts over segment.

```{r}
library(Seurat)
library(Rcongas)
library(dplyr)

x <- Rcongas::congas_example

counts <- get_input_raw_data(x, as_matrix = TRUE)

counts_stab <- FindVariableFeatures(counts %>%  t)

rownames(counts_stab) <- colnames(counts) %>%  make.names(unique = T)

# we just need a dataframe with genes as rownames and the mean and the variance respectively on
# the first and second column 

to_remove <- filter_genes(counts_stab[,c(1,4)], plot = T)

# Now our count matrix is ready for the CONGAS analysis 
counts <- counts[, -which(colnames(counts) %in% to_remove)]


```

Another difficult task is to choice of the right prior for the library size factors as it affects a lot the final quality of the inference. If you are not sure or to get a decent starting point Rcongas provides a function to fit an hypothetical library size distribution under tha monoclonal assumption, that can be a good starting point.

```{r}

x <- Rcongas::congas_example


coeff <- approx_theta_prior_params(x, plot = TRUE)

# The function provides a multiplicative factor for the shape and the rate, 
# this gives us a sort of control over the variance.
# Remember that values less than one increase the variance, while values 
# values larger than one decrese the variance
coeff_large <-  approx_theta_prior_params(x, plot = TRUE, mult_factor = 1/2)

coeff_small <-  approx_theta_prior_params(x, plot = TRUE, mult_factor = 2)

```
